This is a simple landing page project with 4 content sections and a navigation bar.

---

## Project Requirements

#### we were required to do three main things :

1. Build a dynamic navigation bar, which means that the unordered list in html will be populated by javaScript, not explicitly written in html.
2. When scrolling through the page, the active sections should have different style from the other sections.
3. When we click on any link in the nav bar, scrolling to that link's section should be **smooth**.
